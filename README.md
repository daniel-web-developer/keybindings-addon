# Keybindings for Linux users

## Introduction

I've recently started using i3, and after changing my `$mod` key from `alt` to the `windows key`, I've decided to just change it back to `alt` and use `ctrl` to change tabs. How would I do it, though?

I didn't wanna install any add-on made by a third party that isn't monitored by Mozilla (I'm a bit paranoid lol) so I decided to write my on. It's pretty simple but I think I learned a lot and it was fun to do it.

## Future features

I plan to make it possible for the user to use `j` and `k` instead of the arrows to navigate.
